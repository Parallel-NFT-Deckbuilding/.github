## ♾ What is Parallel?

Parallel is a competitive Web3 sci-fi trading card game (TCG) built around NFT cards and a unique multi-faction system. Players choose a Parallel (faction), build decks from NFT-owned cards, and battle others in strategic 1v1 matches to earn PRIME tokens. The game blends polished visuals, lore-rich mechanics, and deep deck customization.

Each NFT card has real utility — and with multiple Parallels to master, gameplay is both tactical and collectible.
